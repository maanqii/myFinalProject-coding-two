# myFinalProject-coding-two

I made an ancient style appliance exhibition, plus my very favorite music, I recently like ancient culture, the exhibition is also made of related items, so I used blender to learn to make a lot of models myself, I thought I could put together a collection of models I made to make a small display, which allows everyone to better be able to see them.

Its core thrust is to load the 3D model. setup() function initializes various settings and loads the 3D model. update() function updates the position of the 3D model and modifies the OF mesh. draw() function draws the 3D model and the OF mesh and handles lighting and textures. keyPressed() function handles user input to switch between the 3D models. It also loads an MP3 file and plays it at 50% volume.

The user can switch between the different models to display them. The application uses OpenGL for rendering and OF for graphics and sound.

Here are the main features and functions of the application.

Use loadModel() to load the 3D model.
Use setPosition() and setScale() to set the position and scale of the 3D model.
Use playAllAnimations() and setPausedForAllAnimations() to play and pause all animations.
Use the keyPressed() function to switch between 3D models.
Use the noise function to modify OF's mesh to create a liquid-like effect.
Use ofDrawBitmapString() to display text commands.
